Cultivating seasame provides a valuable source of oil used in cooking, skincare products, and traditional medicine. Additionally, seasame cultivation promotes biodiversity and soil health, as the plant thrives in a variety of climates and soil types. By growing seasame, farmers can diversify their crop portfolio and contribute to sustainable agriculture practices.',
